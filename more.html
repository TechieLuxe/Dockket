<h2><u>Fundamental Basis Of a CBIR System:</u></h2>
<p><ul>
<li><h3><u>Database Collection:</u></h3> 
    An organized collection of digital images aimed at the efficient management and the processing of queries on this image collection.<br><br>

<li><h3><u>Feature Extraction:</u></h3>
    Feature extraction is a part of the dimensionality reduction process, in which, an initial set of the raw data is divided and reduced to more manageable groups. So, when you want to process it will be easier. The most important characteristic of these large data sets is that they have a large number of variables. These variables require a lot of computing resources to process. So, Feature extraction helps to get the best feature from those big data sets by selecting and combining variables into features, thus, effectively reducing the amount of data. These features are easy to process, but still able to describe the actual data set with accuracy and originality.

<li><h3><u>Indexing and Matching:</u></h3>
    A large number of images are available on internet. Efficient and effective retrieval system is needed to retrieve these images by the contents of the images like color, texture and shape. This system is called content-based image retrieval (CBIR). CBIR is an intensive and difficult area of research. CBIR is performed in two steps: indexing and searching. In indexing step contents (features) of the image are extracted and are stored in the form of a feature vector in the feature database. In the searching step, user query image feature vector is constructed and compared with all feature vectors in the database for similarity to retrieve the most similar images to the query image from the database.

<li><h3><u>Image Retrieval:</u></h3>
    An image retrieval system is a computer system used for browsing, searching and retrieving images from a large database of digital images. Most traditional and common methods of image retrieval utilize some method of adding metadata such as captioning, keywords, title or descriptions to the images so that retrieval can be performed over the annotation words. Manual image annotation is time-consuming, laborious and expensive; to address this, there has been a large amount of research done on automatic image annotation. Additionally, the increase in social web applications and the semantic web have inspired the development of several web-based image annotation tools.
