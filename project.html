<h1>CBIR using Color and Texture Pattern</h1>
</center>
<h2><u>Introduction:</u></h2>
<p>Content-based image retrieval (CBIR) is the most important area for computer visible and image processing. This was used in different fields such as medicine, health, cultural heritage, crime prevention, and so forth. CBIR is a well-defined image search and retrieval technique based on its visual content within a large collection of data. Retrieval of images is characterized by local or global characteristics that rely on visual details. The image properties, such as color, form, and texture, describe the global characteristics.</p>
<p>Color is a commonly used visual function in CBIR and is discussed primarily in the literature. The primary aim is that humans mainly tend to distinguish stimuli by colored lines. Texture is also an important picture surface property and is defined by a similarity of visual patterns that reflects the most significant surface-related details such as bricks, tiles, clouds, and so on. Such descriptors are also suitable for retrieving medical images.The shape descriptors do not mean the entire shape of the image is defined, but it does describe the shape of the particular region of an image. Forms are also used for segmentation or contour detection. The methods used for the form descriptors are invariance for translation, rotation, and scaling.</p>
<p>The retrieval of images from the datasets has been, by using the visual content, a highly complex research subject since the 1990s. Nonetheless, most work does not take adequate account of the semantic dimension of images which comprises the fundamental semantic difference between the results produced by the device and the user experience. Nowadays, researchers are trying to develop novel approaches to solve the complex problems.</p>
<h2><u>Content Based Image Retrieval System:</u></h2>
<p>Content-based image retrieval, also known as query by image content (QBIC) and content-based visual information retrieval (CBVIR), is the application of computer vision techniques to the image retrieval problem, that is, the problem of searching for digital images in large databases. Content-based image retrieval is opposed to traditional concept-based approaches.</p> 
<p>"Content-based" means that the search analyzes the contents of the image rather than the metadata such as keywords, tags, or descriptions associated with the image. The term "content" in this context might refer to colors, shapes, textures, or any other information that can be derived from the image itself. CBIR is desirable because searches that rely purely on metadata are dependent on annotation quality and completeness.</p>
